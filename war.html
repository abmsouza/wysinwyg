				<span><span class="emphasis">Deepfakes </span> hold great damaging potential in an era that is already labelled as <span class="emphasis">post-truth</span> of inciting violence, denying facts, generating even more profound social divisions, affecting elections worldwide, and resulting in deeper disbelief of institutions and media outlets.</span>

				<span>Their potential for social erosion arrives in a time when people are already greatly exposed to fake news and "alternative facts". More and more people become informed from social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp, that all carry the potential to generate and publicize unfiltered content which can be used to micro-target social groups. These tools, among others, also have enabled "information cascades" allowing people to transmit information without checking for veracity.</span>

		<p><span class="emphasis">According to experts, to solve the problem of fake news, we need to regard this issue as sociotechnical. It is a complex problem that demands more than one front of attack.</span></p>
		<p>Technologically, possibilities of defence that we may become familiar in the near future are media forensics, where the fake content could be detected by technical means, and somewhat filtered to mainstream media. We may grow familiar with other ways to tie content to reality as well. Two other possibilities to potentially limit the damage of deepfakes are the widespread authentication of content, a way of certifying true content before diffusing them to the public, and even "authenticated alibi services", in which likely targets as public figures and politicians would engage in a way have their lives documented to such an extent that they could counter deepfake attacks by presenting an alibi - this one, a speculative approach.</p>
